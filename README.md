# 👋 Welcome to My Coding Journey

Hi there! I'm Jatin Sharma – this repository is a reflection of my ongoing learning and growth as a developer.

Here you'll find my practice work on:

- 🌐 **Web Development** (Frontend + Backend)
- 🎨 **Animations**
- ⚙️ **DevOps**
- 🛠️ Experiments, mini-projects, and fun challenges

I'm constantly learning, building, and improving. This repo serves as both a **learning log** and a **sandbox** for trying out new tools, concepts, and frameworks.

Feel free to explore, learn with me, and drop a ⭐️ if you find anything helpful!
